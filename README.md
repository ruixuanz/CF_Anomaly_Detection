* This project aims at anomaly detection based on IDM car-following model, using EKF combined with One Class SVM.

* Select <code>run_exp.m</code> for one run.

* Select <code>grid_search.m</code> for multiple runs with different parameters predefined in <code>config.ini</code> file.

* Need to be run on MATLAB 2017b or later verion.
