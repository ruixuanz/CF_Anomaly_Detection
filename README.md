# Real-Time Sensor Anomaly Detection and Recovery in Connected Automated Vehicle Sensors

The code is for paper [Real-Time Sensor Anomaly Detection and Recovery in Connected Automated Vehicle Sensors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01531.pdf).

This project aims at anomaly detection based on IDM car-following model, using EKF combined with One Class SVM.

Select run_exp.m for one run.

Select grid_search.m for multiple runs with different parameters predefined in config.ini file.

Need to be run on MATLAB 2017b or later verion.
